states:
	local state
	cross-compo state
	app-wide state

redux vs context
simpler syntax
performance

rules:
1store
components never change the date(we use reducers for that)
dispatch makes reducer fn to action

using redux
createStore
reducer 2 arguments and it is a PURE fn
create "compo"
subcribe

test
dispatch
